This repo contains open-source datasets behind the graphics, interactives, and analyses at [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends). Every day we will add new datasets behind our graphics and charts. 

<b>What is the data?</b>
The data primarily comes from our analysis of Google Trends, but will on occassion include other Google tools such as YouTube, Play and Waze. It is primarily:
• Aggregated
• Anonymised
• Indexed
• Normalized

<b>What can we do with it?</b>
The data is deliberately designed for you to play with, explore and create visualizations. We want to know what you do so we can share it on our social channels and inspire others to play with it too.
